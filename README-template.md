## Overview

I was scaring from CSS just few days ago but then I saw some video about someone's experience he showed me a tutorial and its great I am still watching that tutorial and it making feel me great because I can understand how HTML and CSS works. It feels great. I can not tell you how good feeling this is. How ever I finished this challenge and suprisingly I done responsive design without knowing I am making responsive design. I just used the flex. After finishing the Desktop version I typed how to make responsive design without meida queries and it was saying use flex, grid etc. I knew Used flex then I thought about is that posible to I made the card responsive without knowing I am making a responsive design then I just realised I made a responsive design Without knowing I am making a responsive design.
